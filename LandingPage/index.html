 	<div id="intro"> 
 		<h1 id="introTitle">What is Station Controller?</h1>
 		<p id="introDesc">The goal was to automate a model roller coaster (made of the popular Knex building toy) using an Arduino and an iOS application. The iOS app communicates with an Arduino which controls the three motors and sensor incorporated into the station. This allows the operator to control the coaster and guest to interact with it.</p>

 	<div id="coaster">
 		<h1 class="sectionTitle">The Coaster</h1>
 		<img class="sectionImgRight" src="assets/media/coaster1.jpg" alt="coaster">
 		<p class="sectionDescLeft">Each year during Rochester Institute of Technology's Imagine RIT festival, the RIT Theme Park Enthusiasts have an exhibit featuring a large scale model roller coaster. Previously, the model's only powered feature was its lift hill which was difficult to control and had no guest interaction. The Station Controller would simplify the use of the lift hill by club members while also adding other features for guest interaction.</p>

 	<div id="components">
 		<h1 class="sectionTitle">Components</h1>
 		<img class="sectionImgRight" src="assets/media/station1.jpg" alt="station">
 		<p class="sectionDescLeft">The station has three main "moving" components. These include the lift hill, the station gates, and the dispatch system. There is also a sensor to detect the car.</p>
 		<ul class="sectionList">
 			<li>Dispatch System: Powered by a standard DC motor, the dispatch system brings the stopped car in the station to the lift hill.</li>
 			<li>Station Gates: A servo motor is connected to a rod which pivots all four station gates.</li>
 			<li>Lift hill: A CIM motor powers the chain lift that brings the car up the first hill. This motor stays on.</li>
 			<li>Platform Sensor: An IR sensor mounted on the back of the left platform detects if the train is in the station or not.</li>
 		</ul>
